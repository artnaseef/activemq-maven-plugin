This is a modified clone of the activemq-maven-plugin from the 5.10.0 activemq sources.  It is intended as a stop-gap
for those needing the newer functionality with the older broker until the newer broker is released.

With that in mind, minimal changes should be needed to gain access to the updated functionality.  For example, the
version number of this project matches the version number of ActiveMQ against which it is built.
